Task:

Implement calculator

Requirements:

The calculator can perform operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with two or more numbers
When you press =, the calculation result becomes the main input value. For example, for the image above, if you press =, then 7 goes away, and instead of “5 + 2”, 7 appears as the main input value. Further entry of other operations is applied to 7. Entering any digit erases 7 and a new operation starts.
Data can be entered both with the mouse (by clicking on the buttons), and using the keyboard
If the operation cannot be performed (e.g. division by 0) or an error has occurred - show an error message
It is forbidden to use third party libraries like mathjs and also using eval

Bonus implementation:

Percentage operations. For example: 100 + 20% (result 120)
Decimal point operations: 5.2 + 1.3 (result 6.5)
